  fl_repeatable_weapon_type_strike_craft_fire_damage_fire_rate_desc:0 "Increasing the speed at which fighter pilots can process and act upon enemy positioning data elevates strike craft a few steps up the food chain.\nBy collecting and analyzing the performance data of the pilots that came before, we have exponentially improved our pilot training methods. Each one will be quicker than the one that came before."
